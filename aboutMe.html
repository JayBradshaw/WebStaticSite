	<p>My entire life I have enjoyed sports, especially golf, and spending time outdoors. I love camping, hiking,
	and playing games wiht my family. I have always had a knack for education and did very well in school when I was
	younger. I am currently in my third semester studying computer science at <a href="http://www.usu.edu/"  alt="Link to Utah State Homepage">Utah State University</a>. Since becoming an Aggie, I have had a lot of <a href="myAdventures.html" alt="Link to My Adventures Page">adventures</a> 
	and entertaining moments that I would like to share with others. Especially those who are considering coming to 
	Utah State. Go Aggies!</p>
