	<h1>My Adventures</h1>

	<h3> Fall 2015</h3>
	<h5>Water Sliding Down Old Main Hill</h5>
	<p>The week before my first semester of classes started there was a giant waterslide down Old Main Hill
	It was actually a little bit dangerous as we had soap to make us more slippery and, by the time my roomate and
	I arrived, the grass at the bottom of the hill was torn up which created a lot of mud. We were all soaked and muddy when we finally got back to the apartment later that afternoon.</p>


	<h3> Spring 2016</h3>
	<h5>Sledding down Old Main Hill</h5>
	<p>Once again Old Main was involved to begin a new semester. My roomate had the idea to use tire inner tubes to sled down Old Main hill.
	We went with a big group of friends and were having a lot of fun. Eventually, we got tired of going down the same spot, so my friend Christian 
	moved to another section of the hill that had a jump part of the way down and urged us to join him. As we competed to see who could get the most air off the jump, we figured out that the best way to go was to get a running start, and then dive head-first onto the tube so that you could see and steer more easily.
	My turn came once again and I decided that I would make sure that I beat everyone else. I got a running start, jumped onto the tube, then slid at an incredible
	speed down the hill hitting the jump square in the middle. That's the last thing I remember before waking up in the car as we were headed to the hospital.</p>


	<h3> Fall 2016</h3>
	<h5>Bloomington Lake</h5>
	<p>The week before fall semester began this year my roommates and I along with some other friends took a camping trip to Bloomington Lake. It was quite the adventure as my roommate nearly got us lost more than once traveling poorly maintained dirt roads. After arriving at the lake, we proceeded to stare at the water wondering who would be the first to brave the rope swing. While it was nerve racking the first time, it quickly became very entertaining as we continued to swing through the air yelling and screaming before we hit the water. After the rope swing, my girlfriend Ashley and I decided that we would scale the cliff and jump in from there. No one else had the guts to do it, but after jumping I definitely didn't regret it. It was a wonderful start to a new semester.</p>
